            <h2>Welcome to the Pokéwar!</h2>
            <p>This game is not unlike the card game war. We will be choosing two random
            Pokéballs from the battle page, and when you win a battle both Pokémon will be 
            moved to your Pokédeck. </p>
            <p>How it works: When you go to the Pokéwar battle page select 
            two Pokéballs. The first Pokéball that you select will be your 
            Pokémon for the battle. The second one you choose is the Pokémon you are
            battling. When your pokémon wins both of the Pokémon and they will be moved 
            to your Pokédeck! The game will also reset</p>
            <p>If you lose or tie your game you will be able to continue selecting Pokéballs until 
            you run out, and then you will need to reset the page to start again.</p>
